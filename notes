JDBC notes -

recap -
mysql connector java is the dependency we have added

we need 3 things to work with DB
address of DB - url
Name of DB -
Username, password -

Connection class - to establish the connection with DB
make a statement - it allows us to send the query to the DB
resultset - the result will be started in its object

rset.next() - to shift the cursor on to the next line/row

resultsetmetadata - it contains the information about the result such as how many columns are
there , how many rows, name of columns/ rows etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

to integrate with framework, we will pass url, username and password in config.prop file

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

in order to integrate our db in framework , we create dbutility class

select emp_firstname, emp_lastname
from hr_hs_employee
where employee_id='12345';

we have added a scenario in addemployee feature file
we have added steps in add employee steps page
we have added tag of the scenario in runner class


scenario is to capture the employee id from UI
and verify it with the DB
for this, we have added scenario in feature file
and added in step definitions

then we are verifying firstname, middlename, lastname etc one by one
because we cannot compare bunch of value in one attempt

                                     API

   in postman - base URL + endpoint

   in rest assured API
   base URI = base URL

   hamcrest matchers -
   hamcrest is a popular framework that helps us to create matcher objects.
   It is used for writing tests and performs testing in programming. Hamrest is mainly used with other testing
    frameworks like junit.

    Hamcrest matchers -
    class that contains methods to perform assertions
